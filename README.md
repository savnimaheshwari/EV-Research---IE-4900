# How did COVID-19 and Federal Subsidies impact Electric Vehicle Adoption? A Machine Learning Approach

## Project Description
This research-based project aims to leverage prior studies to explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent federal legislation on electric vehicle (EV) adoption. By preparing a comprehensive dataset and applying machine learning models, we seek to uncover insights into the factors influencing EV adoption trends in the United States. The findings will assist decision-makers in identifying bottlenecks and key leverage points for fostering EV adoption.

## Project Objective
Use advanced data science techniques to better understand electric vehicle adoption trends in the United States.

## Project Deliverables
- **Dataset Preparation**: Compile a dataset (2013-2023) containing electric vehicle registrations and state-level variables such as population density, income levels, charging infrastructure, and policy incentives.
- **Analysis**: Apply supervised machine learning models, including Lasso and Ridge regression, to understand relationships and predict EV adoption trends. Use ARIMA for time-series forecasting of EV sales.
- **Presentation**: Present the analysis findings through visualizations and a comprehensive report, highlighting actionable insights.

## Features of the Repository
- **Dataset**: Includes processed and raw data files for EV registrations and relevant state-level variables.
- **Code**: Python scripts for:
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning.
  - Feature engineering.
  - Implementing machine learning models (Lasso, Ridge, ARIMA).
  - Visualization of results.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive explanations of methods, findings, and future research directions.
